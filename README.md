## Key Principles

### The Goal: Criticality, Not Correctness
Residuality Theory shifts the architect's goal from achieving "correctness" (the programmer's domain) to achieving **criticality** - the sweet spot where a system can adapt to change without collapsing.

### From Stable to Critical to Chaotic
- **Stable**: Predictable but rigid, cannot adapt
- **Critical**: Optimal resilience, can survive unexpected changes
- **Chaotic**: Unpredictable cascading failures

### Random Simulation Works
A counterintuitive insight: random simulation of stressors on a naive architecture produces better results than traditional requirements engineering, risk management, or reactive change management.

### Residues Over Components
Instead of decomposing systems into components, Residuality models systems as interconnected **residues** - parts that persist under stress.

## Why Residuality Theory Matters

Traditional software architecture approaches often fail in complex business environments because:
- Requirements are unknowable upfront
- Business environments are inherently uncertain
- Systems are judged by survivability, not initial correctness
- Over-optimization for known scenarios creates brittleness

Residuality Theory addresses these challenges by:
- Making uncertainty management fundamental to design
- Using stressor analysis instead of detailed requirements
- Focusing on what survives rather than what's "correct"
- Applying complexity science to software architecture
