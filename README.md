# Learning Residuality Theory

A comprehensive learning repository for mastering Residuality Theory - a revolutionary approach to software architecture that fuses Software Engineering, Complexity Science, and Philosophy to design resilient, antifragile systems.

## About This Repository

This repository follows the systematic "Learning [TOOL/FRAMEWORK NAME]" convention for structured knowledge acquisition. Residuality Theory, developed by Barry O'Reilly, provides a framework for designing software architectures that thrive in uncertain, complex business environments by modeling systems as interconnected residues rather than traditional components.

## Learning Path

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of software architecture fundamentals
- Familiarity with systems thinking
- Basic knowledge of risk management and requirements engineering
- Open mindset to challenge traditional architectural approaches

### Recommended Learning Sequence
1. Start with **Theory** (100-series) to understand core concepts
2. Build **Foundations** (200-series) in philosophy and complexity science
3. Master **Stressor Analysis** (300-series) techniques
4. Apply **Practical Techniques** (400-series)
5. Practice **Building Residual Architectures** (500-series)
6. Complete **Labs** (600-series) for hands-on experience
7. Study **Case Studies** (700-series) for real-world insights
8. Utilize **Tools and Templates** (800-series)
9. Explore **References** (900-series) for deeper learning
